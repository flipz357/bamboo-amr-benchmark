# Bamboo AMR Similarity Benchmark

## What do you need?

You need a metric that can input two files 
with n parallel AMR graphs each (in ususal AMR SemBank Penman format) 
and output n scores of meaning similarity (one per line). That's it.

## Evaluation example based on simple BOW toy metric

We have prepared an example that shows how to test your AMR metric on the full benchmark.

See `evaluation-suite/README.md`

Alternatively, metrics can be tested on parts of benchmark, such as, e.g., STS MAIN.
